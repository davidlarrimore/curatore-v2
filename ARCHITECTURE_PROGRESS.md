# Curatore v2 Architecture Refactor Progress

> **Full Requirements**: See `/UPDATED_DATA_ARCHITECTURE.md` (1400+ lines)
> **Start Date**: 2026-01-28
> **Current Phase**: Phase 0 - Stabilization & Baseline Observability

---

## Quick Reference: Core Architectural Principles

1. **Extraction is infrastructure** - Automatic, opinionated, consistent (not per-workflow)
2. **Experimentation precedes automation** - Test/compare/iterate before pipelines
3. **Artifacts are first-class** - Every output is addressable, inspectable, reusable
4. **Separation of concerns** - Import ≠ Processing ≠ Output Sync
5. **UI explains outcomes, not implementation** - Users see assets/results, not jobs/queues

### Storage & Consistency Rules
- **Database is source of truth** - Object store contains only bytes
- **Strict object store layout** - Fixed prefixes only (raw/, extracted/, runs/, experiments/, exports/)
- **Derived data is rebuildable** - Only raw assets are non-replaceable

### Core Data Lifecycle
```
Import/Ingest → Canonicalization (Auto Extraction) → Processing & Experimentation → Output Sync
```

## Key Data Models to Implement (Across Phases)

### Core Models (Phase 0-1)
- `Asset` - Immutable raw content with provenance
- `ExtractionResult` - Canonical extracted content per asset
- `Run` - Execution of logic against extracted content
- `RunLogEvent` - Structured logging for runs
- `RunArtifact` - Outputs produced by runs

### Metadata Models (Phase 3)
- `AssetMetadata` - Flexible, versioned, attributed metadata artifacts

### Scraping Models (Phase 4)
- `ScrapeCollection` - Web scraping projects
- `CrawlRun` - Individual crawl executions
- `PageAsset` - Per-URL snapshots

### Scheduling Models (Phase 5)
- `ScheduledTask` - Recurring task definitions
- `SystemRun` - Link between scheduled tasks and runs

### Domain Models (Phase 7)
- `Solicitation` - SAM.gov opportunity lifecycle
- `Notice` - Time-versioned SAM.gov notices

---

## Object Store Structure (Final State)

```
raw/asset/{asset_id}/                              - Immutable originals
extracted/asset/{asset_id}/v{extractor_version}/   - Canonical extractions
runs/run/{run_id}/artifacts/                       - Run outputs
experiments/experiment/{experiment_id}/variants/   - Experimental outputs
exports/sync/{sync_id}/                            - Published payloads
```

**Critical**: No ad-hoc or user-defined paths permitted.
